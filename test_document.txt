Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines.

Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling systems to learn from data.
It allows computers to improve performance without being explicitly programmed.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines vector search with language models.
Documents are split into chunks, converted into embeddings, and stored in a vector database.
During a query, the most relevant chunks are retrieved and passed to the language model.

FastAPI is a modern Python framework for building APIs.
It is commonly used for machine learning and backend services.
